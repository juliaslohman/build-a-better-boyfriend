## Background Info and Project Description
This website was made for an assignment in Scripps College's Advanced Digital Art ART143 class.

Below are excerpts of the assignment description:

> This project involves researching potential future technologies, and then creating an artifact (in any medium) that tells the story of an imaginative future technology from your world, and the consequences of that technology.
>
> I ask you to cast yourself in the role of an archaeologist in the year 2020. During a routine dig, you have somehow found a fragment of your artifact from the future.
>
> For the final presentation, I want you to present your fragment or collection of fragments in a format (ANY format) that helps to decipher what this fragment might tell people now about the future. Think about how your fragment(s) might be analyzed, investigated, or decoded.

## Artist Statement
Over this summer break, I watched “The Imagineering Story” docuseries on Disney+, about how the Disney parks and rides are created. One of my takeaways was how quickly - over just a few decades - animatronic robotics has progressed. And I know that AI, similarly, has become exponentially more advanced. Seeing these amazing technologies grow prompts speculation about what they could be used for in the future. The expected culmination of these two technologies combined is something like Blade Runner’s ‘replicants,’ a robot that is just short of being human. Most sci-fi media I’ve seen has imagined such a being as a slave, solely used for labor purposes. But if all we wanted was slave labor, why give it intelligence? Furthermore, why so pessimistic about such an amazing technology? Would humans really be so cruel to something that so closely resembles ourselves?

I can’t see any reason why an advanced, near-human robot wouldn’t be used for more human needs. And what’s more human than looking for love?

__My future imagines a world where you can create your own soulmate. AKA: build a better boyfriend.__

My artifact for the ‘build a better boyfriend’ concept is a website that both advertises the companion robot as a product and also allows you to begin the process of designing it by choosing preferred gender, facial features, personality traits, interests, religion, et cetera… However, you can’t finish this project — the website has been damaged and fragmented in its traverse from the future to our present, where it was accidentally discovered through Google search by a lonely woman hoping for love. Feel free to click or tab around and see how the site has been corrupted (and exposed) in its journey.

When began formulating the verbiage of the service’s advertisement, I couldn’t help imagining that the concept was being pitched to lonely, oppressed housewives in the fifties, so I incorporated fifties advertising aesthetics and strategies into the website. I've always thought it's kind of funny that retro magazine ads have long, heavyhanded paragraphs of text that try to convince you to buy the product, something that you would never see in a modern ad. However, maybe this style would see a resurgence in the future, especially since a concept as complicated as building a person requires some explanation.

Perhaps it seems a bit silly to combine something advanced and amazing from the future with the trivialities of the suburban lifestyle of the past. But I think a lot of consumers would love to be whisked off by their Prince/ss Charming to suburban bliss. The heart of this project is that humans desire the simple things in life (companionship, domesticity), and soon our technology will be so advanced that it will be able to artificially construct these simple pleasures.

However, a technology like this would not be all sunshine and lollipops. Some of the things revealed in the website's glitches will make you wonder about how a capitalist corporation might commodify love. Explore thoroughly to find some things that Replicant Robotics may not want you to see.

## React Info
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
